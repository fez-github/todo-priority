# Todo-Priority

Task management application developed in Svelte 3 TypeScript. Inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix, this app runs a basic task system where you may add any tasks you want. In addition to the task name, you may also set up to 3 priority values. Urgency stands for whether it needs to get done or not, importance is for whether this task is important to you, and time represents how long it will take to finish it. These values should help with decision making on what tasks take priority over others.

No account registration is needed. All tasks are stored within localStorage in your browser.
